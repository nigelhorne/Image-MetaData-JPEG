Image-MetaData-JPEG
===================

A Perl package for accessing and modifying JPEG meta-data.

This package provides an interface for reading and interpreting the
content of JPEG segments, in particular of those segments containing
metadata (like TIFF headers, thumbnails, Exif info, IPTC info, comments
...). Some segments can even be modified and rewritten to disk. Maybe,
it will be extended to TIFF files in the future. I am too lazy to
describe the module again here, so have a look at the accompanying
documentation. This module is still EXPERIMENTAL and highly incomplete,
use it at your own risk.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES

This module was designed in order to depend on the least possible number
of modules. Currently, it only requires "integer" (in addition to, of
course, "strict" and "warnings"). It was developed with Perl 5.008004,
on a Debian/Linux box.
