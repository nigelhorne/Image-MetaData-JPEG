        * saved current version as Image-MetaData-JPEG-0.12, posted to CPAN

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_thumbnail):
	this private method is called by set_Exif_data when the $what
	argument is set to 'THUMBNAIL'. $data must be a reference to a
	scalar value (undefined is an error!). First, we erase all thumbnail
	related records from IFD1 then we reinsert those which are appropriate.
	Last, the update method is called (this also fixes some fields).
	--> $$data eq '': nothing else to do, thumbnail erased.
	--> $$data equal to a JPEG stream: thumbnail data are saved in
	  the root level directory, and a few records are added to IFD1:
	  'JPEGInterchangeFormat' (offset), 'JPEGInterchangeFormatLength',
	  and 'Compression' set to six (this indicates a JPEG thumbnail).
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (parse_segments): don't claim empty
	files are valid JPEG pictures; in this case, the method dies 
	immediately. Saying what is a valid JPEG file is not easy ...

        * saved as private version 0.11f
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_thumbnail): 
	preliminary implementation of "set thumbnail". This allows to insert
	a JPEG thumbnail or to remove it (uncompressed thumbnails not yet
	supported, and it won't be easy).
	
        * all save operations in test scripts rewritten so that they use
	in memory variables instead of writing to disk. The only real disk
	access is in t/JPEG_2JPEG_class.t for testing pourposes.
	
2004-10-30  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (screen_records): new
	feature. The syntax hash can have a fifth field, acting as a filter.
	Unless it matches the optional $fregex argument, the record is
	rejected. This allows us to exclude some tags from general usage.
	If $fregex is undefined, all tags with a filter are rejected. This
	mechanism is currently used only for the Exif thumbnail.
	(screen_records): match against /^$rule$/s and not /^$rule$/, i.e.,
	use the 's' modifier, forcing the binded scalar to be interpreted
	as a single string (thumbnail data is rejected otherwise ...)
	(remove_app1_Exif_info): if $index is undefined, it defaults to -1.
	So, both (-1) and undef cause all Exif APP1 segments to be removed.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (save): it is remarkable that this method
	can write not only to a disk file, but also to a variable in memory.
	A disk file is written if $filename is a scalar with a valid file
	name; memory is instead used if $filename is a scalar reference.
	Documentation updated. Tests added to t/JPEG_2_JPEG_class.t
	
2004-10-29  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (ordered_record_list):
	this helper function returns an ordered list of records. Records are
	sorted according to the numerical value of their key; if the key is
	not numeric, but its translation matches Idx-n, n is used. If even
	this fails, a stringwise comparison is performed ($REFERENCE records).
	Used only by set_Exif_data().
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: added an example on how to adjust
	the DateTime record in Exif APP1 IFD0, since this seems very popular

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (string_manipulator): this new
	routine is used by Record::get_description to format $ASCII and
	$UNDEF values. Unreasonably long strings are trimmed and non-printing
	characters are replaced with their hexadecimal representation. Strings
	are then enclosed between delimiters, and null-terminated $ASCII
	strings have their last character chopped off (but a dot is added
	after the closing delimiter). $ASCII strings use a " as delimiter, 
	while $UNDEF strings use '. Test scripts and files corrected.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm ($HASH_APP1_ROOT_GENERAL): this
	new hash table describes the root directory of an Exif APP1 segment.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (screen_records): during
	the textual-to-numeric translation stage, apply the translation only
	if the tag, translated with JPEG_lookup, is numeric (before, it was
	applied when the untranslated tag was not numeric). This allows us
	to introduce "translations" for records with textual tags only: the
	translated tag will be of the form "Idx-$n", and $n will be used to
	force an ordering. For instance, ('Identifier', 'Endianness', 
	'Signature', 'ThumbnailData'), in the root directory of an Exif APP1
	segment, are translated to ('Idx-1', 'Idx-2', 'Idx-3', 'Idx-4').

2004-10-28  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_TIFF_header):
	the 'Endianness' record is not an Exif record, so its type is not 
	defined; it was turned to the $UNDEF type, to allow for a syntactical
	rule to be used on it. In general, the difference between $ASCII and
	$UNDEF is meaningful only in true Exif records (the former have a
	terminating null character, the latter correspond to a completely
	free format): one should conform to this prescription at least in
	APP1 and APP3.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_app1): this method
	now looks for specific named records with search_record_value, instead
	of relying stupidly on the first record.

2004-10-27  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_data): added
	a special case for ROOT_DATA: you can only modify the endianness (and
	only to $BIG_ENDIAN or $LITTLE_ENDIAN), everything else is rejected.
	A few tests added to t/JPEG_5_exif_IMAGE.t.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_ifd): correction
	for the usual (and here benignous) reference-to-empty-string bug.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (follow_path): no more; the
	functionality of this method is now almost completely in search_record,
	so the code for follow_path could be included in the only two methods
	requiring it: Segment::dump_ifd and JPEG::get_Exif_data.

	* t/JPEG_1_segments.t: a few tests added for Segment::search_record

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (search_record): completely new
	design for this method: it searches for a record with a given key in
	a given record directory, returning a reference to the record if the
	search was fruitful, undef otherwise. Search specified as follows:
	  1) a start directory is chosen by looking at the first argument:
	     if it is an ARRAY ref it is popped out and used, otherwise the
	     top-level directory (i.e., $this->{records}) is selected;
	  2) a $keystring is created by joining all remaining arguments on
	     '@', it is exploded into a @keylist on the same character;
	  3) these keys are used for an iterative search starting from the
	     initially chosen directory: all but the last key must correspond
	     to $REFERENCE records. If $key is exactly "FIRST_RECORD" /
	     "LAST_RECORD", the first/last record in the current dir is used.
	The behaviour is now similar to that of the JPEG_lookup function, and
	should spare some lines of code. Trivial modifications in the following
	methods: (Segment methods) follow_path, provide_subdirectory,
	parse_app1_exif, parse_ifd, parse_resource_data_block, dump_com,
	dump_ifd, dump_app13, (JPEG methods) get_comments, get_dimensions,
	get_app0_data, is_app1_Exif, get_Exif_data, build_IFD_directory_tree,
	is_app13_ok, retrieve_app13_subdir, set_app13_data, (test scripts)
	JPEG_1_segments.t, JPEG_4_app13.t, JPEG_5_exif.t.
	(search_record_value): a simple wrapper around search_record(): it
	returns the record value if the search is succesful, undef otherwise.

        * saved as private version 0.11e
	
	* t/JPEG_5_exif_IMAGE.t: this small test script checks the IMAGE_DATA
	alias for IFD0_DATA and SUBIFD_DATA (supported in JPEG_app1_exif.pl).

2004-10-26  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm: $NATIVE_ENDIANNESS is calcula-
	ted every time and represents the native endianness of the current
	machine. It is exported in the :Endianness group.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (check_consistency): updated
	not to fail with floating point numbers (decimal numbers cannot
	always be converted to floating point numbers, so the comparison
	must be limited to, say, six decimal digits). It is now possible
	to set the FovCot tag .....

2004-10-23  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (set_data): replace \do{''}
	with \(my $ns = "") [thanks to A. Komarnitsky for helping in finding 
	the inconsistency in my previous stupid approach].
	(new): ditto

2004-10-22  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm
	(decode_integers): was decode()
	(encode_integers): was encode(), see later for this refactoring.
	(decode_floating): this method decodes a data area containing a
	sequence of floating point numbers, correctly taking into account
	the endianness. The type size $n can therefore be only 4, 8 or 12.
	But we cannot support extended double precision on 32-bit machines
	in general! (it is not required for JPEG decoding though)
	(encode_floating): obviously, the reverse of decode_floating. I
	suspect it is buggy and non-portable and a testing headaches.
	(new): the ctor has now the ability to read floating point values.
	(get): the get method has now the ability to encode floating points.
	(get_description): use %g as format string for floating point numbers
	A lot of tests added to check for this floating implementation.
	
2004-10-21  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_various.pl (get_app0_data): this
	method now returns a reference to a hash with a plain translation
	of the content of the first interesting APP0 segment (this is the
	first 'JFXX' APP0 segment, if present, the first 'JFIF' APP0
	segment otherwise). Segments with errors are excluded. An empty
	hash means that no valid APP0 segment is present.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): ditto
	(multi_level_merge): removed

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (get_app13_data): this method
	now returns data from the first appropriate APP13 segment only (undef
	if no such segment exists). The previous behaviour was inconsistent
	with JPEG::set_*_data, and it brought in more hassle than good. If one
	really has a strange file with more than one APP13 segment, he must
	deal with this strange case by accessing the segments individually.
	Tests and documentation updated.
	
2004-10-20  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm ($HASH_APP01_IFD0_MANDATORY): 
	there are now two distinct hashes: %$HASH_APP1_IFD0_MANDATORY and
	%$HASH_APP1_IFD0_MANDATORY, possibly differing.
	
	* t/JPEG_5_exif_IFD1.t: now t/JPEG_5_exif_IFD.t
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (screen_records): this
	is now a method, and its arguments are ($this, $data, $path); this
	new approach allows for more flexibility while checking for syntactical
	rules (indeed, also for more errors). Moreover, the method now simply
	returns the list ($data_rejected, $data_accepted) [in this order], so
	you still get $data_accepted only in scalar context (but note that the
	order in list context was the opposite before). Changed set_Exif_data
	to take this modification into account.

2004-10-16  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

        * saved as private version 0.11d
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (check_consistency): this class
	static method receives a number of Record features (key, type and
	count) and a list of values, and tries to build a Record with that
	type and count containing those values. On success, it returns the
	record reference, on failure it returns undef. This subroutine is
	currently used by screen_records in JPEG_app1_exif.pl

2004-10-15  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (screen_records): 
	new feature: if a record value is a code reference instead of an
	array reference, the corresponding code is executed (passing the
	optional third argument $optional) and the result is stored. This
	is necessary for mandatory records which need to know the current
	segment. This feature is forbidden to the user (currently).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (generate_lookup): this function
	now returns a hash reference. Also, non-exported hashes in Tables.pm
	are now addressed through their references. Also, %HASH_IPTC_GENERAL is
	no more exported (access it with JPEG_lookup{'APP13@__syntax_IPTC'}).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (screen_records): moved
	%special_screen_rules's content into Tables.pm, where it belongs to.
	Now, a "super-regular-expression" is no more a special string, but
	a reference to an anonymous routine, stored in Tables.pm, and the
	screen_records method just recognises and executes it.
	The %special_screen_rules hash was a dispatch table for special
	syntax check routines (for those values which are not easy to test
	with a regular expression). These routines had to die if the test
	fails in any way.

2004-10-14  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* t/JPEG_5_exif_SubIFD.t: script for set_Exif_data with SUBIFD_DATA

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_data): adapted
	and tested for SubIFD, including Tables.pm; the %IFD_SUBDIRS hash has
	now some new deep entries, with key equal to '__mandatory', supplying
	mandatory records for a give $what (see set_Exif_data).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (new): the Segment constructor
	now has a new mandatory argument (the first one): a reference to the
	parent entity (a JPEG structure object in general, but it can also
	be undef for "orphan" segments). This reference is currently used to
	get the picture dimensions for the mandatory 'Pixel*Dimension' in the
	Exif SubIFD, but it is going to be needed for other tags in the future.
	Additional files which required modifications: JPEG.pm, JPEG_app13.pl,
	JPEG_app1_exif.pl, JPEG_comments.pl and some test files. Tests added
	to the Segment ctor: it dies if some arguments are invalid.
	
2004-10-12  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl
	(retrieve_Exif_subdirectories): suppressed

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (follow_path): this new
	helper method follows a '@' separated list of dir names and
	returns the final record list (or undef).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): 
	modified to accept the following values for $what: 
	- ROOT_DATA      APP1               (TIFF header records and similar)
	- IFD0_DATA      APP1@IFD0          (primary image TIFF tags)
	- SUBIFD_DATA    APP1@IFD0@SubIFD   (Exif private tags in IFD0)
	- GPS_DATA       APP1@IFD0@GPS      (GPS data in IFD0)
	- INTEROP_DATA   APP1@IFD0@SubIFD@Interop(erability in IFD0)  
	- IFD1_DATA      APP1@IFD1          (thumbnail TIFF tags)
	- IMAGE_DATA     a merge of IFD0_DATA and SUBIFD_DATA
	- THUMB_DATA     an alias for IFD1_DATA
	- THUMBNAIL      the actual (un-)compressed thumbnail
	- ALL            a structured merge of everything but THUMBNAIL
	A few tests were added to t/JPEG_5_exif.t. Documentation updated.

2004-10-09  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (%HASH_APP3_SPECIAL/BORDERS) :
	tag names changed to something more "significant" ....
	(%HASH_APP1_IFD01_MAIN, %HASH_APP1_IFD01_ADDITIONAL)
	(%HASH_APP1_IFD01_COMPANIES, %HASH_APP1_SUBIFD_GENERAL),
	general reorganisation of these tables, containing tags for IFD0,
	IFD1 and SubIFD, with types, counts, regular expressions and
	support levels for various encodings and sections. Also, added
	some undocumented tags coming from Photoshop >= 7.0 treatment of
	raw camera files (any real reference welcome ...)

2004-10-08  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (is_signed): this method now
	returns true or false, instead of 'Y' or 'N' (more intuitive).
	(get_description): bug correction. Integer and rational numbers
	were always printed as signed integers. Now the correct conversion,
	'%u' for unsigned integers and '%d' for signed integers, is applied.
	Test added (this is subtle, because only appears to human beings).
	
2004-09-30  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): when
	mapping the record list reference, one should make COPIES of the
	array references found in $_->{values}, otherwise the caller could
	use them to corrupt the internal structures. This was a terrible
	bug discovered indirectly by the coverage test. Its solution consists
	simply in replacing $_->{values} with [@{$_->{values}}]. Two tests
	added to t/JPEG_5_exif.t. Two tests also added to t/JPEG_4_app13.t
	for get_app13_data, but it was not affected by the problem.
	(multi_level_merge): this helper function implements the container
	merge necessary to JPEG::get_Exif_dat, and is more robust. Two
	tests added to t/JPEG_2_rare.t to actually test a merge of more
	than two segments.

2004-09-29  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_comments.pl (join_comments): the
	two warnings have been transformed into exceptions.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_app1): new checks

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (open_input): when testing $file_input
	for being a reference, explicitly ask that it is a scalar reference.
	(new): bug corrected, the call to close_input was lacking the
	current object pointer (i.e., $this-> before it). This confirms
	that Perl is not for serious programming.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (update): trying to update a
	segment with errors calls 'die' now, not 'warn'. The same happens
	when trying to update a segment with no update support. Now, there
	is also a check on the number of records: trying to update a segment
	with no records throws an exception (this should catch segments
	created with the 'NOPARSE' flag, which clearly do not own records).
	(new): if the data reference among the arguments of the constructor
	is undefined, we definitely must save a reference to a modifiable
	empty string (like in \do{''}) and not to an unmodifiable one (like
	in \""). This was forbidding the update of initially "empty" segments.
	(set_data): the most robust approach for clearing the current buffer
	is to reset the buffer reference with a reference to a modifiable
	empty string (\ '' is unmodifiable)
	(output_segment_data): if the segment is too long and cannot be
	output, raise an exception (a warning is not effective).

	* beginning test coverage and bug hunting session.
	
	* t/JPEG_2_JPEG_class.t: the old t/JPEG_1_constructors.t and
	t/JPEG_2_methods.t are now merged in this file, which tries to
	test the Image::MetaData::JPEG class. A new t/JPEG_1_segments.t
	test script tries to test the Image::MetaData::JPEG::Segment class.
	
2004-09-28  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (insert_segment): this method inserts
	a new segment into the current list of segments at position $pos.
	If the segment reference is undefined, the method fails silently.
	If $pos is undefined, the position is chosen automatically (using
	find_new_app_segment_position); if $pos is out of bound, an
	exception is thrown; this happens also if $pos points to the first
	segment and it is SOI. $segref may be a reference to a single
	segment or a reference to a list of segment references; everything
	else throws an exception. If overwrite is defined, it must be the
	number of segments to overwrite during the splice. This method is
	now used in JPEG_comments.pl, JPEG_app13.pl and JPEG_app1_exif.pl.
	Tests added to t/JPEG_2_methods.t. Documentation updated.
	
	* constructs like $seg = $this->{segments}; @$seg = ... replaced
	with @{$this->{segments}} when not too cumbersome. Same for %$
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (drop_segments): [thanks to Christopher
	C. Weis for suggesting this feature] this method erases from the
	internal segment list all segments matching the passed $regex
	regular expression. If $regex is undefined or evaluates to the
	empty string, this method throws an exception, because I don't want
	the user to erase the whole file just because he/she did not
	understand what he was doing. The apocalyptic behaviour can be
	forced by setting $regex = ".". As a special case, if $regex ==
	"METADATA", all APP* and COM segments are erased. Documentation
	updated. Tests added to t/JPEG_2_methods.t.
	(drop_segments) is now used inside remove_all_comments,
	remove_app1_Exif_info and remove_app13_info.
	
2004-09-26  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* saved as private version 0.11c

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_various.pl (get_dimensions): bug
	corrected. This routine was not checking that the required records
	were present (they are not there when the segment is not parsed).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (parse): bug corrected.
	If there is no error during this routine, $this->{error} must be
	left undefined; setting it to $@ does not work because it can be ''.
	(parse): the selection of the specific parse routine is now a
	Perl "switch", with a fallback case dispatching to parse_unknown().

	* t/JPEG_2_rare.t: this new test script is meant to catch errors
	in seldom used methods (which is not easy to fit in other test
	scripts), like reparse_as(), get_app0_data(), parse_unknown();
	it was suggested by a coverag test with Devel::Cover. Also added
	a t/test_frankenstein.jpg with examples of some application
	segments not found in the standard t/test_photo.jpg

2004-09-25  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl
	(parse_resource_data_block): bug corrected. The trivial value for a
	data block name in Photoshop APP13 is the empty string ("", length 0),
	not the null character ("\000", length 1). This avoids a lot of 
	stupid <> in the output of Record::get_description.

2004-09-24  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl: almost all methods updated 
	for $APP13_PHOTOSHOP_DIRNAME and its management. This is probably
	not the cleanest solution, but it can do the job for the time being.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_app13): updated
	for $APP13_PHOTOSHOP_DIRNAME (also dump_resource_data_block).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl 
	(parse_resource_data_block): updated for $APP13_PHOTOSHOP_DIRNAME

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm: new $APP13_PHOTOSHOP_DIRNAME
	variable with value 'Photoshop_RECORDS'; this is for supporting
	Photoshop records in a separate directory, in order to make their
	management similar to that of IPTC data. %JPEG_RECORD_NAME modified.

	* t/JPEG_4_app13.t: updated set of tests for Photoshop/IPTC routines.
	Test files are: JPEG_4_app13_IPTC.t, JPEG_4_app13_set.t, JPEG_4_app13.t

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (generate_array): new variable
	$APP13_IPTC_DIRNAME = 'IPTC_RECORDS' in Tables.pm in group TagsAPP13.

2004-09-22  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl: all methods in this file
	were changed to reflect the new approach for getting/setting Photoshop
	data; the list of new names is as follows:
	(retrieve_app13_IPTC_segment) --> retrieve_app13_segment(index, what)
	(is_app13_IPTC)               --> is_app13_ok(what)
	(provide_app13_IPTC_segment)  --> provide_app13_segment(what)
	(remove_app13_IPTC_info)      --> remove_app13_info(index, what)
	(get_IPTC_data) ... 2x        --> get_app13_data(type, what)
	(set_IPTC_data) ... 2x        --> set_app13_data(data, action, what)
	many changes in helper rotines and algorithms, too long to explain
	here. Read about the new interface in JPEG.pod.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: reorganisation of this man page and
	new sections on getting/setting Photoshop data. This changes the
	previous interface a bit, but, hey, I told you that it could happen!

	* MANIFEST: added a test for the perldoc page based on Pod::Checker
	as t/JPEG_p_podchecker.t (test skipped if the module is not there)

2004-09-20  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

        * tested as version 0.11b

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl 
	(forge_interoperability_IFD): this method takes care to create an
	Interoperability IFD with standard values (dimensions are calculated).
	This should avoid creating gratuitous inconsistencies.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_data): added
	support for INTEROP_DATA. Tests for this software are collected in
	JPEG_5_exif_INTEROP.t. Documentation updated in JPEG.pod

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_GPS_DATA): this
	method was merged with set_Exif_data after making it more general.
	The generalisation to other data types should now be simpler ....

	* t/JPEG_4b_IPTC.t: renamed to JPEG_4_IPTC_syntax.t
	* t/JPEG_5b_exif.t: renamed to JPEG_5_exif_GPS.t

2004-09-19  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (JPEG_lookup): corrected a bug
	which was preventing keys evaluating to false from being accepted.
	"unless $key" is not the same as "unless defined $key".

2004-09-18  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (screen_records): 
	This helper function takes a hash reference $data and an IFD path
	specification $path, like 'APP1@IFD0@GPS'. It tries to convert the
	elements of $data into valid records according to the specific
	syntactical rules of the corresponding IFD. It returns a list of
	two hash references: the first list contains the key-recordref
	pairs for successful conversions, the second list the key-value(ref)
	pairs for unsuccessful ones. ... this function extracts and
	generalises the syntax tests which were once in set_GPS_DATA.
	(%special_screen_rules): this hash is a dispatch table for special
	syntax check routines (for those values which are not easily tested
	with a regular expression). I suspect this will grow a lot ...
	(complement_records): another helper routine for inserting records
	into hashes when they are not already present. These routines
	should be used only inside the screen_records function.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (%IFD_SUBDIRS): A sub-hash can
	also have a '__syntax' key, returning a hash of syntactical
	properties to be respected by data in the corresponding IFD. This
	special entry is of course treated differently from the others
	... It was introduced in order to collect in the same place all
	information necessary for setting new data in IFD-like segments. As
	a first result, it avoids the need to export %HASH_GPS_GENERAL. A
	syntactical specification for key $key is now accessed in the
	following way: @{$IFD_SUBDIRS{'APP1@IFD0@GPS'}{__syntax}{$key}};

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (build_IFD_directory_tree):
	This method, obviously, creates a (sub)directory tree in an IFD-like
	segment (i.e. APP1/APP3), and takes care of the "extra" field of the
	newly created directories if mandatory or useful. I really think that
	this "extra" field should be managed differently ....

2004-09-17  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

        * Set all my e-mail addresses in the package to <bettelli@cpan.org>
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (%IFD_SUBDIRS): reorganisation
	of this hash, which was not flexible enough; it is now a two-level
	hash, supporting some changes in JPEG_app1_exif.pl. All relevant
	files have been updated (Segment_dumpers.pl, Segment_parsers.pl).

2004-09-15  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm: corrected a bug slipped in
	at some point during the rewrite of Tables.pm; the following line
        our $THTIFF_LENGTH = JPEG_lookup('APP1@IFD1@StripOffsets'); had to be
	our $THTIFF_LENGTH = JPEG_lookup('APP1@IFD1@StripByteCounts');.
	Since the error was not showing up however, this stuff is probably
	redundant, or I am missing something ...

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (JPEG_lookup): this method now
	joins all arguments (references are rejected) on '@', then splits
	the result string on '@' again, in order to be more consistent and
	simpler (?). Calls of JPEG_lookup changed accordingly in Record.pm,
	Segment_parsers.pl, Segment_dumpers.pl, JPEG_app13.pl and
	JPEG_app1_exif.pl.

2004-09-04  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: removed the REFERENCES section in
	appendix, and the "references" file from the package. All relevant
	references will be written directly to the perldoc page. Also,
	reworked the Interoperability IFD section a bit.
	
2004-09-03  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

        * tested as version 0.11a

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (set_IPTC_data): forced an
	ordering on keys during the initial scan; this is necessary because
	the same key can be present twice, in numeric and textual form, and
	we want the corresponding value merging to be stable (numeric keys
	goes first). Same thanks as for the previous bug.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_ifd): use
	for (sort keys %IFD_SUBDIRS) ... instead of for (keys %IFD_SUBDIRS),
	so as to fix an undefined ordering in the APP1 IFD0 subdirectories.
	This was causing a lot of problems during "make test". Thanks to
	Andrea Maestrutti, Dan Eble, and the perl.cpan.testers for helping
	correcting this bug.

	* t/JPEG_5_exif.t: changed some stupid "is_deeply" to "is".

2004-08-08  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

        * saved current version as Image-MetaData-JPEG-0.11, posted to CPAN

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_data_GPS_DATA): 
	thanks to the previous changes, when creating a new (empty) GPS
	subdirectory, it is not necessary to insert a 'GPSInfo' offset record,
	only the 'GPS' REFERENCE record; if fact, its value would in any case
	be wrong, and it will be calculated automatically at update time.
	We need however to set the "extra" field of this REFERENCE record,
	in order to mimick the case when it is parsed directly from a file.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_TIFF_header): 
	since we decided not to register offset records, the 'IFD0_Pointer'
	record was dropped (i.e., its value is read and used, but it is
	not stored in the main record list). This change is even more
	natural since its value is almost always 8. Trivial doc. changes.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_ifd): modified
	this method to take changes in parse_ifd into account. There is a
	special treatement for tags holding an IFD offset; these tags are
	regenerated on the fly (since they are no more stored) and their
	value is recalculated and written to the raw data area. This should
	change absolutely nothing in the final file layout.
	(dump_app1_exif): the final call to reparse_as() is no more necessary;
	this was the old warning note: currently, the dump process in Exif
	APP1 recalculates some offsets (IFD links), but does not overwrite
	the parsed records, so that the raw data area and the parsed structure
	are not in sync. Reparsing the segment is a quick fix, but I really
	should update the IFD links' records, or, even better, avoid to write
	these offsets among the records, because they are not interesting
	to the end user.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_ifd): this 
	method, after setting up the concerned IFD, searches for deeper
	IFDs with the help of %IFD_SUBDIRS and, if found, parses them
	recursively; for every new subdir, a REFERENCE record is created,
	pointing to it. This method was changed in the following way:
	the originating offset record is removed because it contains very
	fragile information (it should be recalculated every time something
	changes in Exif APP1, for instance, carrying close to zero info);
	moreover, its textual tag is saved in the "extra" field of the
	generated REFERENCE record (just for reference).
	
2004-08-07  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* Saved as PRIVATE version 0.10f

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm: deeply modified the layout.
	Some variables make now use of JPEG_lookup, instead of declaring
	redundantly other variables. This may be a bit slow, but is cleaner.
	Also, I have declared all private variables with 'my' and all
	exportable ones with 'ours'. Then I have prepared subclasses of
	exportable variables with %EXPORT_TAGS, so that they can be 
	imported selectively by the various modules and files. No variable
	is now exported by default.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: trivial change in the section about
	Record objects to document the new JPEG_lookup function. But this
	documentation needs to be revised to report about import rules.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): updated
	to use JPEG_lookup instead of searching directly %JPEG_RECORD_NAME;
	(set_Exif_data_GPS_DATA): same thing

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl: updated the %IPTC_tags
	and %IPTC_names hashes in order to use JPEG_lookup.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (get_description): modified
	to use JPEG_lookup instead of searching directly %JPEG_RECORD_NAME.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm: moved @JPEG_RECORD_TYPE_LENGTH,
	@JPEG_RECORD_TYPE_CATEGORY and @JPEG_RECORD_TYPE_SIGN to Table class.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (JPEG_lookup): this helper
	function returns record data from the %JPEG_RECORD_NAME hash. The
	argument list is a list of keys for exploring the variuous hash
	levels; e.g., if the list is ('APP1', 'IFD0', 'GPS', 0x1e), the
	selected value is $JPEG_RECORD_NAME{APP1}{IFD0}{GPS}{0x1e}.
	If, at some point during the search, an argument fails (it is not
	a valid key) or it is not defined, the search is interrupted, and
	undef is returned. Note also that the return value can be a string
	or a hash reference, depending on the hash search depth. If the key
	lookup for the last argument fails, a reverse lookup is run (i.e.,
	the key corresponding to the value equal to the last user argument
	is searched). If even this lookup fails, undef is returned.

2004-08-06  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@cpan.org>

	* Saved as PRIVATE version 0.10e

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: added a section about changing Exif
	data (which currently is limited to GPS data), and a very extensive
	appendix about valid records for Exif APP1, which will be used as
	a line guide for the future Exfi setters.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_data_GPS_DATA): 
	this method implements the setter of Exif GPS data; it includes a
	lot of format checks and it is moderately simple, since GPS tags
	are not too complicated. A lot of tests added to check GPS data
	syntax. Documentation updated (so, read there ...)
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (set_Exif_data): entry
	point for setters of Exif APP1 data. It works a hash reference $data,
	$what in /GPS_DATA|...todo/ and $action in /ADD|UPDATE|SET/, but this
	interface might not be "official".
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_app1_exif): added
	a reparse_as at the end of this method; currently, the dump process
	in Exif APP1 recalculates some offsets (IFD links), but does not
	overwrite the parsed records, so that the raw data area and the
	parsed structure are not in sync. Reparsing the segment is a quick
	fix, but I really should update the IFD links' records, or, even
	better, avoid to write these offsets among the records, because they
	are not interesting to the end user.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): check
	added; this method returns immediately (with undef) if the current
	Segment is not an Exif APP1 Segment.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (get_description): C-strings,
	i.e., null-terminated strings, have now the last null character
	chopped off, but a '.' is written after the closing '"'. This 
	should make the output more readable.
	
2004-08-05  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Saved as PRIVATE version 0.10d

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): updated
	the Structure-level method to deal with the different data types
	returned by the Segment-level method. Tests added.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl (get_Exif_data): added
	a second argument ($what) controlling the subset of Exif records
	returned by this method (this is far too long to explain here,
	read the documentation for this). Summarising:
	- ALL          (all Exif and preamble records)    ref to hash of hashes
	- IMAGE_DATA   IFD0 + IFD0@SubIFD  (primary image)   ref to hash
	- THUMB_DATA   IFD1                (thumbnail image) ref to hash
	- GPS_DATA     IFD0@GPS            (GPS data)        ref to hash
	- INTEROP_DATA IFD0@SubIFD@Interop (interoperabilty) ref to hash
	- THUMBNAIL    (the thumbnail data area in APP1)     ref to scalar
	Tests added. Documentation updated. This approach should be much
	more user-friendly and looks like the definitive interface I want
	to use for inquiring Exif data.
	
2004-08-04  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Saved as PRIVATE version 0.10c

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (set_IPTC_data): corrected
	a silent bug: when testing for the presence of the RecordVersion
	tag, don't just check that there is an entry in the hash, but also
	check that the array pointed to by this hash is not empty.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (set_IPTC_data): a new
	functionality added to the "setter". The $action argument can be:
	- ADD : new records are added and nothing is deleted; however, if
	  you try to add a non-repeatable record which is already present,
	  the newly supplied value replaces the pre-existing value.
	- UPDATE : new records replace those with the same tags, but the others
	  are preserved. This makes it possible to modify repeatable records.
	- REPLACE : all records present in the IPTC subdirectory are deleted
	  before inserting the new ones.
	So, 'ADD' and 'REPLACE' are as before, while 'UPDATE' is new and
	allows for selective replacement of some tags. The default remains
	'REPLACE'. Documentation updated. Tests added and updated.

2004-08-03  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app2_ICC_tags):
 	updated to reflect the changes in Record::get_size.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_interop):
	updated to reflect the changes in Record::get_size.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (create_record): $count means
	now "length" if the record type is variable-length and the data area
	is specified through an offset (but I think this never happens).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (new): according to the new
	meaning of "count" in the Record class, the argument $count in the
	constructor changes like this: if the type is fixed-length, $count
	is mandatory and must correspond to the number of values to be
	read from the passed scalar; if the type is variable-length, $count
	is optional (if specified, it is a counter-check; it must correspond
	to the size of the passed scalar).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm: some useless incoherences
	eliminated (dangerous?): the type length in @JPEG_RECORD_TYPE_LENGTH
	for non-numeric types (currently ASCII strings, UNDEF strings and
	Perl references) is set to zero; it is meant with this that the type
	length is variable, and all sizes should be accepted. This implicitely
	changes Record::get_size to return 0 also for ASCII and UNDEF.
	
2004-08-01  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app1_exif.pl: changed JPEG_exif.pl
	to JPEG_app1_exif.pl, for uniformity with JPEG_app13.pl

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: re-checked and clarified the part
	of the documentation concerning IPTC data management, including
	all previous changes and a note on what is translated when 
	'TEXTUAL' is on (tags, i.e, keys, not the values).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (set_IPTC_data): reworked
	this method. Added a new logic for $action == 'ADD': old values
	are merged to new ones; if this leads to the violation of a non
	repeatability constraint, only the new value is retained (this is
	done by the new helper function shift_non_repeatables). Added
	a new logic to make sure that a 'RecordVersion' record is always
	present. Updated all IPTC tests relevant to 'set'.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm: corrected a bug in the 'word',
	'line' and 'paragraph' regular expression for IPTC data (they were
	accepting an arbitrary prefix or suffix). Corrected and updated
	the appropriate tests in t/JPEG_4b_IPTC.t.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (get_IPTC_data): do not
	delete the 'RecordVersion' record from the returned hash. I do
	not know if this is the right choice, but the previous behaviour
	was not documented either. Added a test for this.

2004-07-19  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Saved as PRIVATE version 0.10b

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (get_segments): the passed regular
	expression is now changed to "." if undefined or set to the empty
	string (thus returning all segments or all indexes). I do this
	because I want to avoid the stupid behaviour of m//:
	from `man perlop`: if the pattern evaluates to the empty string,
	the last successfully matched regular expression is used instead;
	if no match has previously succeeded, this will (silently) act
	instead as a genuine empty pattern. Added two tests against this.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_exif.pl (is_app1_Exif): bug corrected;
	this was crashing when presented an APP1 segment without a record
	called 'Identifier' (this happens for XML APP1 segments ....)

2004-07-18  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* t/test_photo.jpg, t/test_photo.desc: reduced the test image size,
	this cuts down its weight from ~ 200KB to only 33KB.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (save): added binmode for file open
	calls (it turned out that on Windows it really makes a difference,
	also when writing). Thanks to Andrea Maestrutti for help with this bug.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (show_directory)
	(Directory_Banner): added protections against invalid
	references among function arguments. Mark invalid references.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (get_description): chomp
	is run only if $this->{error} is defined (avoid error situations).

2004-07-16  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* t/JPEG_1_constructors.t, t/JPEG_2_methods.t: added binmode for
	file open calls (it turned out that on Windows it really makes a
	difference!). Thanks to Andrea Maestrutti for help with this bug.

	* t/JPEG_0_records.t: added (it had been left out from the module
	submitted to CPAN because it was not listed in MANIFEST).
	
2004-07-13  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * saved current version as Image-MetaData-JPEG-0.10, posted to CPAN
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: documentation updated. IPTC info
	largely rewritten. Exif info introduced. New appendices.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (output_segment_data): added
	a debugging check on the maximum size for a segment.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (set_IPTC_data): substantial
	modification of this methods (many more checks). It now accepts IPTC
	data in various formats and updates the IPTC subdirectory in the
	segment. The key type of each entry in the input %$data hash can be
	numeric or textual, independently of the others (the same key can
	appear in both forms, the corresponding values will be appended).
	The value of each entry can be an array reference or a scalar (you
	can use this as a shortcut for value arrays with only one value).
	The $action argument can be 'ADD' or 'REPLACE', and it discriminates
	weather the passed data must be added to or must replace the current
	datasets in the IPTC subdir. The return value is a reference to a
	hash containing the rejected key-values entries. The entries of %$data
	are not modified. An entry in in the %$data hash can be rejected
	for various reasons:
	  - the tag is textual or numeric and it is not known;
	  - the tag is numeric and not in the range 0-255;
	  - the entry value is an empty array;
	  - the non-repeatable property is violated;
	  - the tag is marked as invalid;
	  - the length of a value is invalid;
	  - a value does not match its mandatory regular expr.
	This is a major improvement on the formerly unattended user input.
	There is not a similar check on data already written in the file,
	because it is not clear what one should do in presence of "errors".

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (value_is_OK): this private
	function is able to test wether a given array of values fits with
	a given IPTC tag. Info is taken from %HASH_IPTC_GENERAL. It is
	called only by set_IPTC_data.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pm (find_new_app_segment_position): added
	a check, just in order to avoid a warning for half-read files with
	an incomplete set of segments; no "position" is returned past the
	segment array end (i.e. not smaller than scalar get_segments()).
	Added a test against this case.

2004-07-12  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (get_IPTC_data): changed
	the behaviour of this method, which is now a generalisation of
	the method with the same name in the Segment class, not only an
	interface to. First, all IPTC APP13 segment are retrieved (if
	none is present, the undefined value is returned). Then,
	get_IPTC_data is called on each of these segments, passing the
	argument ($type) through. The results are then merged in a single
	hash and a reference to it is returned.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG.pod: added a reference section as an
	appendix specifying the set of valid IPTC tags for APP13, as
	well as the additional constraints on their values. The same
	information is now available in %HASH_IPTC_GENERAL in Tables.pm

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (get_IPTC_data,set_IPTC_data): 
	removed the "XML" option, since it was really only poorly implemented
	in the getter; it will be reinstated only when and if there is a
	real need for this. Modified the perldoc page accordingly.
	
2004-07-11  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_exif.pl (retrieve_app1_Exif_segment): 
	(provide_app1_Exif_segment, remove_app1_Exif_info, get_Exif_data)
	(set_Exif_data, [Segment]is_app1_Exif, retrieve_Exif_subdirectories)
	(get_Exif_data) new methods very similar to APP13 IPTC high level
	functions. They implement, of course, the "read" part of Exif APP1
	segments. The get_Exif_data method returns a reference to a hash
	containing a named (the tag) hash references. Each sub-hash contains
	a copy of all Exif tags/values present in a particular IFD (sub)di-
	rectory (including a special root directory containing some tags
	and the links to IFD0 and IFD1). As usual, the output format can
	be "NUMERIC" or "TEXTUAL". An example of the returned reference is:

	{ APP1                     => { Endianness => [ "II" ], ... },
	  APP1@IFD0                => { Model => [ "KODAK DX3900" ], ... },
	  APP1@IFD0@SubIFD         => { FocalLength => [117, 10], ... },
	  APP1@IFD0@SubIFD@Interop => { InteroperabilityIndex => ["R98"], ...},
	  APP1@IFD1                => { XResolution => [72, 1], ... }
	}
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (set_IPTC_data): added an
	explicit protection against an undefined value for the first argument

2004-07-10  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (remove_app13_IPTC_info): 
	this new method eliminates all traces of IPTC information from
	the $index-th APP13 IPTC segment. If, after this, the segment is
	empty, it is eliminated from the list of segments in the file.
	If $index is (-1), all APP13 IPTC segments are affected at once.
	Added some tests for this in JPEG_4_iptc.t
        	
2004-07-10  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_app1),
	(dump_app1_exif, dump_TIFF_header, dump_ifd): implemented a set of
	routines for dumping an Exif APP1 segment to disk. The thumbnail
	size is checked for consistency. All records within an IFD are
	ordere according to their tags. There is no unused space in the
	dump, so just calling update() on an Exif APP1 segment even without
	modifying its content can give you a smaller file (some tens of
	kilobytes can be saved). Checked it works on all my pictures.

2004-07-09  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (encode, decode): corrected
	various bugs for signed types and nibbles. Logic rewritten. The
	directive "use integer" was abandoned, since it limits integers
	to signed 32-bits (while we need at least unsigned 32-bits). The
	performance drop is probably negligible if the computer has a
	math coprocessor. Written a comprehensive test suite for the
	Record class (t/JPEG_0_records.t).
	
	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (set_data): this method now
	accepts a reference or a scalar as first argument, and treats it
	accordingly (this avoids copying in some contexts).

2004-07-08  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app1_exif,
	parse_app3): adapted to the new parse_ifd style. These routines
	look now much simpler (although they are a bit less flexible).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_ifd): this
	method takes now care to parse the subdirectories of a given IFD
	on its own (using the %IFD_SUBDIRS lookup table). The new argument
	list is ($this, $dirnames, $link, $tiff_base, $offset_ref, $no_next),
	i.e. $tiff_base is a value, not a ref, and @vip_tags is no more.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Tables.pm (%IFD_SUBDIRS): this new enum
	is intended to automatise the parsing of subdirectories of IFDs
	in APP1 and APP3 (needed also for dumping I think).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (set_data): let this method
	return the size of appended data.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Record.pm (encode): corrected two bugs
	on this untested method (overwriting $_ in an internal loop and
	not getting the endianness right).

2004-07-07  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (update): dispatch to 
	dump_app1 if necessary (new methods in Segment_dumpers.pl).

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/Segment.pm (output_segment_data): fixed
	a bug in this method for zero-length comments. In fact, the data
	area of a segment can be void and, nonetheless, the segment might
	require a segment length word; in practise, the only segments not
	needing the length word are SOI, EOI and RST*. Test added.

	* lib/Image/MetaData/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (get_IPTC_data): when the
	option is 'TEXTUAL' (i.e., use textual instead of numerical tags),
	if a numerical IPTC tag is not known, a custom textual tag is
	created with "Unknown_tag_" followed by the numerical value (this
	solves a bug with non-standard tags). What to do for set_IPTC_data?

	* Renamed Image::MetaInfo::JPEG to Image::MetaData::JPEG.

2004-06-25  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.09

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pod: documentation updates, including
	a new introductory section on JPEG files and APP0.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (provide_IPTC_subdirectory): 
	corrected another bug here, thanks to testing.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (update): simplified test

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (find_new_app_segment_position): bug:
	if there is a DHP(SOF) segment, return its position, not the
	position immediately after (because we are replacing there!)

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (parse_segments): don't have dataless
	segments saved in any case (setting $flag equal to undef for them
	was a bug! the logic is now a bit different).

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (new): this really returns undef when
	no error is set now (first "bug" catched with package testing!).

	* t/JPEG_1_constructors.t: initial test set for JPEG ctors
	* t/JPEG_2_methods:        initial test set for JPEG methods
	* t/JPEG_3_comments:       initial test set for comment routines
	* t/JPEG_4_IPTC:           initial test set for IPTC routines
	there is also a test photo in t/ using ~ 200Kb.
		
2004-06-24  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (save): changed to fail immediately
	if the "read_only" member is set (currently, only if the JPEG
	object is opened with the "FASTREADONLY" option).

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (new): there is now a third optional
	argument, $options. If it matches the string "FASTREADONLY", only
	those segments matching $regex are actually stored; also, everything
	which is found after a Start Of Scan is completely neglected. This
	allows for very large speed-ups, but, obviously, you cannot rebuild
	the file afterwards, so this is only for getting information fast,
	e.g., when doing a directory scan.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (parse_segments, get_next_marker)
	(parse_ecs): updated to take the $this->{read_only} field into
	account. The new approach is the following: in general, all segments
	are read, saved and parsed if possible. If there is a regular
	expression argument to the ctor matching only a few segment names,
	only those segments are parsed (they are nonetheless saved). If
	$this->{read_only} is set (see FASTREADONLY later), the segments
	not selected for parsing are not even read and saved; moreover,
	everything after the SOS segment is neglected (this is for fast
	information retrieval).

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (get_data): this method returns a
	portion of the input file (specified by $offset and $length). It is
	necessary to mask how data reading is actually implemented. As usual,
	it dies on errors (but this is trapped in the constructor). This
	method returns a scalar reference; if $offset is just "LENGTH", the
	input length is returned instead.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (open_input): this method, replacing
	"slurp_buffer", takes care to open a file handle pointing to the
	JPEG object specified by $file_input. If the "file name" is a
	scalar reference instead, it is saved in the "handle" member (and
	it must be treated accordingly in the following). Nothing is
	actually read now, only the handle is stored; this is needed for
	FASTREADONLY, see later. There is also a very short close_input().

2004-06-19  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.08

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pod: documentation update, including
	the description of a few "internals", to allow the curious user
	to access directly the result of the segments' parsing.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (find_new_app_segment_position): 
	this algorithm was changed. Now, if a DHP segment is present,
	the method returns the position immediately before the first DHP
	segment; otherwise, it tries the same with SOF segments; otherwise,
	it selects the position immediately after the last application
	or comment segment. If even this fails, it returns the position
	immediately after the SOI segment (i.e., 1).
	
2004-06-18  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/JPEG_various.pl (get_app0_data): 
	this method returns a reference to a hash with the content of
	the APP0 segments (a plain translation of the segment content).
	Segments with errors are excluded. Note that some keys may be
	overwritten by the values of the last segment, and that an empty
	hash means that no valid APP0 segment is present.
		
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/JPEG_various.pl (get_dimensions): 
	revised and commented. This method and get_description() are
	now in a separate file (JPEG_various.pl).
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (JPEG::set_IPTC_data): 
	analogous to JPEG::get_IPTC_data; however, the segment is created
	and initialised with provide_app13_IPTC_segment if it is not
	there, so the segment retrieval should not fail.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/JPEG_app13.pl (JPEG::get_IPTC_data):
	this method is an interface to the method with the same name
	in the Segment class. First, the first IPTC APP13 segment is
	retrieved (if there is no such segment, the undefined value is
	returned). Then the get_IPTC_data is called on this segment
	passing the argument through.

2004-06-17  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (get_next_marker, parse_segments,
	parse_ecs): changed to work on in-memory buffers. This almost
	halves the system read time, but strangely increases the user
	run time, so there must be something I don't understand here.
	Note: ~40-55% processing time is spent in only two methods:
	slurp_buffer and parse_ecs (after a few optimisations).
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (new): the member storing a file
	handle is gone, but we have now a member storing a reference to 
	the JPEG stream. The first argument of the ctor is the JPEG
	stream. The ctor saves the file stream as a private object,
	then it parses it and stores its sections internally. The stream
	can be specified in two ways: [a scalar] interpreted as a file
	name to be opened and read; [a scalar reference] interpreted as
	a pointer to an in-memory buffer containing a JPEG stream.
	This interface is similar to that of Image::Info, but no open
	file handle is accepted.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (slurp_buffer): this method replaces
	the old check_file. It accepts just one argument: if it is a
	reference, it is assumed to point to a JPEG stream and saved
	internally; if it is a scalar, it is interpreted as a file name
	whose content is to be read into memory and treated as before.
	No test on SOI is performed.

2004-06-15  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Record.pm (get_description): non
	printable characters are now replaced with "\" followed by
	a two digit hexadecimal representation (it is shorter than
	a three digit octal representation!).

	* Makefile.PL: arghh ... there was a "use 5.008004" also here!

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_makernote): 
	this new method is the entry point for parsing maker notes.
	It should be easy to extend it to all maker notes whose
	structure follows that of a regular IFD.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app1_exif): 
	if a Maker Note tag is found in the Exif SubIFD, then we should
	try to decode it. This is likely to fail, because most vendors do
	not publish their MakerNote format. However, if the note is
	decoded, the findings are written in a new subdirectory (currently
	I think it is wiser not to delete the unparsed MakerNote record).
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app1_exif): 
	the "garbage" field in APP1 Exif and APP3 was removed, because
	it makes no sense (the IFDs structure is way more complicated
	than I though)!
	
2004-06-13  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (reparse_as): this new method
	re-executes the parsing of a segment after changing the segment
	nature (well, its name). This is very handy if you have a JPEG file
	with a correct application segment exception made for its name. I
	used it the first time for a file having an ICC_profile segment
	 (usually in APP2) stored as APP13. Note that the name of the
	segment is permanently changed, so, if the file is rewritten to
	disk, it will be "correct".

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (parse): this new method
	contains the parse code once written inside the segment ctor.
	This allows the parsing to be rerun (the error message and the
	old parsed records are flushed at the beginning).

2004-06-12  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app2_ICC_tags) &
	(parse_app2_ICC_profiles): these new methods implement the parsing
	of APP2 ICC profiles (there is a subdirectory for the profile
	header and another subdirectory for the tag table). In Tables.pm
	there is a new hash table named %HASH_APP2_ICC.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app2_flashpix):
	This method parses an APP2 Flashpix extension segment, and is not
	really reliable, since I have only one example and very badly
	written documentation. Moreover, I think that the FPXR format is
	the worst format I have ever seen.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app2): this
	new method is the entry point for parsing APP2 segments.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment_parsers.pl (parse_TIFF_header):
	the identifier length is now taken from $good_identifier, while
	before it was fixed to 6 bytes. A similar approach in parse_app1().

2004-06-12  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.07

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pod (Image): Documentation update

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm (parse_segments): initialise
	$segments only once, at the beginning.

2004-06-10  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Record.pm: I gave up trying to calculate
	the length of a Perl reference. This is probably allocation and
	implementation dependent; so I use zero and change the logic 
	where its length is used. This required trivial changes only in
	Record::new and Record::get_size (all other routines are unaffected
	so far, but this is a potential risk for the future ....)

2004-06-09  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * The Image::MetaInfo::JPEG::Structure class is no more; it is
	now called simply Image::MetaInfo::JPEG (this is the package
	name). So, JPEG.pm and JPEG/Structure.pm were merged in
	lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm, the documentation file moved
	lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pod and all other library files left
	in lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/. The change was otherwise trivial.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm: commented "use 5.008004" out.
	I don't really know the Perl version requirements; maybe just
	Perl 5 is sufficient, but I don't know how to test it.

2004-06-07  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Structure.pm (new): There is now a second
	argument, $regex. This string is matched against segment names, and
	only those segments with a positive match are parsed. This allows
	for some speed-up if you just need partial information. For
	instance, if you just want to manipulate the comments, you could
	use $regex equal to "COM". If $regex is undefined, all segments are
	parsed. This required a change also in Structure::parse_segments.
	Remember that SOS segments are needed for get_dimensions().

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (new): there is now an
	optional third argument for the constructor, a flag. If this
	flag matches "NOPARSE", no parse routine is run in the segment
	constructor (this can be done by generating an informative error).
	This probably allows for some speed-up if we don't need the
	information stored in the segment.
		
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Structure_comments.pl (split_comment_string):
	corrected a terrible bug: $max_length is 2**16-3, not 2**16-2 !!!

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (set_data): this new method
	appends (or overwrites, if the second argument is "OVERWRITE")
	a string to the current segment data area. This hides the
	details of how the data area itself is implemented. The only 
	four methods knowing explicitely about Segment::dataref should
	now be new, size, data and set_data.
	
	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (output_segment_data): this
	new method replaces the old get_segment_data. It needs one argument
	more, a file handler, and it prints directly into it instead of
	returning a string; it returns the 1/0 in case the write succeeded/
	failed. Structure::save() needed an obvious update.

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG/Segment.pm (new): the second argument
	to a "new Segment" call is now a reference to a memory area, not
	directly a scalar, and it is saved in Segment::dataref, which
	replaces Segment::data. This makes passing a third argument clearer.
	Some trivial changes were needed in the Segment class (mostly
	transparent, since the access is mediated by Segment::data())
	and in the routines calling the Segment constructor (that is,
	in Structure.pm, Structure_app13.pl and Structure_comments.pl).

2004-06-07  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.06

	* lib/Image/MetaInfo/JPEG.pm: prepared an initial POD file.
	This file is going to be the "official" documentation.

2004-06-06  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * miserably replacing all occurrences of "retrive" with
	"retrieve" \Re*trieve"\ (thanks to my wife).
	
	* COPYING: added a copyright notice to the beginning of this file.
	A shorter (3 lines) notice is present at the beginning of all files
	in lib. Maybe this will not be the final license scheme. See also
	the LICENSE files for license terms. 

	* MANIFEST: initial setup for a CPAN release, following the
	lines of "man perlnewmod". However, this still needs a lot of
	testing, so the package is still "private".

2004-06-04  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>
	
	* Structure_comments.pl (join_comments): this method now calls
	set_comment with the new behaviour, so it is safe against a
	very long joint comment.

	* Structure_comments.pl (set_comment): this method now replaces
	the $index-th comment segment with one or more new segments
	based on the user string. If the string is too big, it is broken
	down and multiple segments are created. If the string is undef,
	the comment segment is erased. If $index is out-of-bound, only a
	warning is printed. This mimics the new behaviour of add_comment.

	* Structure_comments.pl (add_comment): in case the passed string
	is too big (there is a 64KB limit in JPEG segments), it is broken
	down in smaller strings and multiple "Comment" segments are
	inserted in the file (they are contiguous). This replaces the
	previous behaviour of issuing a warning and trimming the string.

	* Structure_comments.pl (split_comment_string): this new method
	splits a string into chunks which can fit in a comment segment.
	Note that "" maps to (""), while an undefined value maps to ().
	So, it is possible to specify an empty comment, and it is different
	from specifying an undefined comment. The comment_trim_string
	method is no longer necessary (removed).
	
	* Segment.pm (Directory_Banner): simplified the string join
	and eliminated the string "Block " in the banner.

2004-06-01  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app3, parse_app1_exif, parse_ifd): 
	code refactoring (some functionalities moved inside parse_ifd).
	This should make APP3 and APP1 parsing more readable.
	
2004-05-30  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Stupid changes using the comma operator in Segment.pm, Record.pm.

2004-05-29  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app12): the interpretation of the
	first line is now less ambitious, the line is simply saved in
	one ASCII field, named MakerInfo (it can contain null characters
	though). This prevents untold errors for APP12 segments whose
	format is really unknown (to me). I am still looking for docs.

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_ifd): I used to complain in case no
	entry was present in the currently analysed IFD, but it turned
	out this is only annoying; so, the warning was removed.

	* Structure.pm (save): modified the method description, to
	make it clear that "high level" methods (those implemented
	in the Structure_<segment name>.pl files) take care of calling
	update(), when needed, on their own. So, a user of the library
	should not care about calling update().

	* Structure_comments.pl (join_comments): this method accepts now
	two arguments: ($separation, @selection). The first string is used
	between every two concatenated strings (it defaults to a newline,
	i.e., "\n"). The second argument is the old single argument.
	$separation is used as first argument of a join() call.

2004-05-05  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.0.5
	
	* Structure.pm (save): This method writes the data area of each
	segment in the current object to a disk file. If the filename
	is undef, it defaults to the file originally used to create this
	Structure object. This method returns "true" (1) if it works,
	"false" (undef) otherwise.
        
	* Structure_app13.pl (get_IPTC_data): implemented a rough XML
	translation for IPTC data. However, it would be more consistent
	to implement something on the lines of parse_app1_xmp().

2004-05-03  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Structure_app13.pl: this file contains a number of utilities
	for managing IPTC data without dealing with the details of the
	low level representation (although sometimes this means taking
	some decisions for the end user ....). The new methods are:
	  Structure::retrieve_app13_IPTC_segment($index);
	  Structure::provide_app13_IPTC_segment();
	  Segment::is_app13_IPTC();
	  Segment::retrieve_IPTC_subdirectory();
	  Segment::provide_IPTC_subdirectory();
	  Segment::remove_IPTC_subdirectory();
	  Segment::get_IPTC_data($type);
	  Segment::set_IPTC_data($data, $action);
	
	* Structure.pm (get_segment): replaces get_segment_indexes. It
	returns segment references, not their indexes. However, the
	previous behaviour is restored if the second argument is "INDEXES".
	This requires some adjustments in the comment utilities file.

	* Structure_comments.pl (add_comment): no need to call update
	at the end of this routine, thus removed.

	* Structure.pm (find_new_app_segment_position): this new Structure
	method finds a position for a new application or comment segment
	to be placed in the file. If a SOS segment is present, it returns
	the position immediately before it; otherwise, it selects the
	position immediately after the last application or comment segment.
	If even this fails, it returns the position immediately after the
	SOI segment (i.e., 1). This affects also Structure::add_comment().

2004-05-02  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Record.pm (get_description) and Segment.pm (show_directory):
	eliminated the $tag_size/$width mechanism.

	* (in all code base) replace "scalar @array" for "1+$#array",
	and "unless" for "if !" (still learning Perl).

2004-05-01  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_app13): this routine, together with
	dump_resource_data_block() and dump_IPTC_datasets(), can dump
	an APP13 segment (read, IPTC data, in particular).

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_resource_data_block): corrected
	a bug (the padding byte is not part of the resource block name).

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_unknown): non-printing characters
	are translated also here. Now, the output of get_description()
	for a Record object should not fool 'grep' into thinking that
	the output is binary.
	
	* Record.pm (get_description): this method now reworks ASCII
	strings a bit before displaying them. In particular it trims
	unreasonably long strings and replaces non-printing characters
	[\000-\037\177-\377] with their octal representation. Note,
	however, that "more chars" counts each non-printing char as four.

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_resource_data_block): non-IPTC
	records are now written in the root directory of an APP13
	segment, instead of the subdirectory "PHOTOSHOP_TAGS". This
	preserves the relative order with respect to the IPTC block.
	The parse_Photoshop_additional() method was removed. If
	there is a non-trivial record description, it is stored in
	the new "extra" field of the appropriate Record object.

	* Segment.pm (search_record): introduced "reserved" keys in
	the record search routine: if $key is exactly "FIRST_RECORD"
	/ "LAST_RECORD", the first/last record in the appropriate record
	list is returned.

	* Record.pm (new): Added a new field, "extra", which can be
	used to store additional information one does not know where
	to put. The need originated from APP13 record descriptions.
	Record::get_description() was modified to show the field.
	
2004-04-30  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Tables.pm (enum): removed all "custom" numeric-to-textual
	translations in %JPEG_RECORD_NAME. In fact, given that 
	Record objects now accept a non-numeric tag, these names
	can be written directly into the code.

	* Segment.pm (search_record): this new method is modelled on
	search_value_by_key (which can now be safely removed), but it
	returns a reference to the first occurrence of a record with
	a given key (this is handy for dumper routines).

	* Record.pm (set_value): this new method allows the modification
	routines not to deal with Record objects internals.

	* Record.pm (get): this new method is the "inverse" of the
	constructor (but it does not erase the record content). In 
	list context, it returns the following list: ($key, $type, $count,
	$dataref). In scalar context it returns $$dataref (note the
	dereferentiation). This is tricky (but handy).

2004-04-27  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Record.pm (extract): reorganisation + comments. extract() is
	renamed as decode(), and the inverse function is provided 
	under the name of encode(). Massive use of map. Danger!

2004-04-26  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.0.4

	* Record.pm (get_description): the ASCII description of a
	record does not require an entry in the hash tables provided
	by Tables.pm. If such an entry does not exist, a default label
	is provided. This allows me to drop a lot of undocumented or
	illegal entries in the aforementioned tables. What to do with
	this kind of records is still to be decided.

	* Record.pm: the length of an anonymous array reference is
	now calculated (it was fixed to 16), because I suspect it can
	change in other versions of Perl, as reported by Martin.

2004-04-25  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app3): double count for garbage
	bytes corrected in the last garbage test.

	* Segment_parsers.pl: all references to $this->{parsed}
	removed. In fact, if a segment remains with $this->{error}
	undefined, it is to be considered correctly parsed.
	Also, all informative messages which are not at error level
	are now treated with "warn", not "print".

	* Segment.pm (Directory_Banner): now a simple subroutine.

	* Segment.pm (get_description): Segment_Banner suppressed and
	its functionality inserted directly in this method, which can
	now show also any error condition occurred during the segment
	construction in the parsing stage (now all segments are shown).
	
	* Segment.pm (update): consistently with the previously stated
	policy, a segment with errors ($this->{error} not undefined)
	cannot be updated (so, it must be rewritten to disk as it is).

	* Segment.pm (new): new error handling strategy also for JPEG
	segments and underlying classes. The parsing routines in the
	constructor of a segment are now executed in an eval block;
	if any error occurs (in the Segment or Record class, which in
	turn implies that parsing was interrupted at some point and is
	therefore incomplete) the "error" member of the relevant segment
	object is set to a meaningful error message. If no error occurs,
	the same variable is left undefined. The reference to the segment
	object is returned in any case. In this way, a "faulty" segment
	cannot inhibit the creation of a Structure object; faulty segments
	should in no case be edited/modified, basically because their
	structure could not be fully understood. They can anyway be
	rewritten to disk untouched, so that a file with corrupted or
	non-standard segments can be partially edited without fear of
	destroying it. $this->{parsed} was suppressed.

	* Structure.pm (new): new error handling strategy. If there is
	an irrecoverable error in the constructor of a Structure object,
	the ctor returns undef and an error message can be retrieved
	with Image::MetaInfo::JPEG::Structure::Error(). This works
	by executing the parsing subroutines in the ctor in an eval
	block, and then checking the value of $@. In this way the
	creation of an Image::MetaInfo::JPEG::Structure object is
	similar to the creation of an Image::IPTCInfo object.

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app1_exif): contrary to my belief,
	there exist IFD0 sections without a SubIFD pointer. Indeed, 
	the whole IFD0 section can contain no fields at all. I modified
	the code so that it does not abort if the link is not present.

	* Segment_parsers.pl (parse_app1_exif): some pictures declare
	they have a thumbnail, but there is no thumbnail link for it
	in the following of the 1st IFD. This case is now treated
	gracefully, without trying to access the undefined link.

2004-04-19  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Structure_comments.pm: this new file contains those functions
	which deal with comment segments in the files. It is loaded by
	Structure.pm, and contains the following functions:
	Structure::get_comments(), 
	Structure::get_number_of_comments(),
	Structure::add_comment($string),
	Structure::set_comment($index, $string),
	Structure::remove_comment($index),
	Structure::remove_all_comments(),
	Structure::join_comments($separation, @selection).
	
	* Structure.pm (get_segment_indexes): this new method returns
	a list of indexes pointing to segments matching a given condition.

	* Structure.pm (show): this method (and its supporting methods
	in the lower level classes) were renamed as get_description().
	They now return a string instead of printing to standard output.

2004-04-18  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Tables.pm (enum): Introduced three unknown tags (231, 232, 240)
	in the HASH_IPTC_RECORD_2 hash (found in a "Canon EOS-1D" image).
	The treatement of these unknown/non-standard tags should be unified.

2004-03-17  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.0.3

        * Added a basic copyright notice based on GPL 2.
	
	* Segment_dumpers.pl (dump_com): this file will contain routines
	which dump segment records into the segment internal data area.
	The simplest routine is for comment blocks.

	* package names changed to Image::MetaInfo::Jpeg::X, where
	X is /Structure|Segment|Record|Tables/; the "highest level"
	package is "Structure".

	* Segment.pm: all segment specific parsing routines are now in
	a separate file (Segment_parsers.pl), which is "required" in 
	the main package file (which was already ~ 100kB).

2004-03-17  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.0.2

	* Tables.pm: new variable ($VERSION) for package version

	* Segment.pm (get_segment_data): this routine dumps the content
	of a segment into a scalar (this includes the segment preamble,
	that is 0xff, the segment marker and the segment data word).
	The data area is read from $this->{data}, not from the parsed
	records (one should provide other routines for storing, segment
	per segment, the [possibly modified] records into $this->{data}).

	* Segment.pm (parse_app1_xmp): this routine contains the simplest
	XML parses able to parse Adobe XMP packets (at least I hope). The
	layout of parsed records is a bit complicated, but this is the way
	XML works (I should be able to reconstruct the full XMP packet
	from this layout, comment excluded, at least I think).

2004-03-15  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Tables.pm (enum): deleted the GPS prefix from GPS tag names.
	Added all TIFF 6.0 tags which are not Exif 2.2 tags to the
	%HASH_APP1_IFD hash, and also looked at tiff.h of libtiff for
	some other vendor specific tags.
 	
	* Segment.pm (parse_app3): simplified, with the same trick
	as for parse_app1_exif (i.e., the update_offset_and_garbage
	local subroutine). This can be done better ...
	
	* Segment.pm (parse_app12): the routine parsing an APP12 segment
	is now more refined and readable; however, I don't have any
	documentation about this format, and only one example so far, so
	parse_app12 should be considered highly experimental.

2004-03-14  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment.pm (new): Deleted the "dirs" member in a JPEG::Segment
	object. There is now a new way to store properties in a segment.
	$segment->{records} gives access to a list of JPEG::Records; most
	of them contains segment properties (key-value pairs), but some
	are REFERENCE records: for these records, the key is a string
	carrying the name of a sub-directory, and the value is a reference
	to this sub-directory, whose structure is the same as for
	$segment->{records}. This mechanism replaces the $this->{dirs}
	hash, and is more flexible. Have a look at JPEG::Segment::show()
	for more details on how to inspect this structure. For instance,
	in APP1 and APP3 there are the following trees:

	               /--APP1--\             APP3
		      /          \             |
	         /--IFD0--\     IFD1       /--IFD0--\
		/          \              /          \
	     SubIFD        GPS         Borders     Special
	       |
	     Interop

	* Record.pm (show): change the test for numeric/non-numeric
	tags from $descriptor =~ /\d/ to $descriptor =~ /^\d*$/.

2004-03-13  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment.pm (store_record): a list reference can now be prepended
	to the argument list; in this case it is used instead of
	$this->{records}. This means that store_record can now be
	used instead of an explicit push also for "subdirectories"
	(provide_subdirectory): this new method searches (creates if
	absent) a REFERENCE record (an internal record linking to a
	subdirectory) and returns its value (the actual reference).
	The record can be inserted in any record list, and defaults
	to the main record list $this->{records}.
	(search_value_by_key): this now works as provide_subdirectory,
	i.e., the second argument is an optional record list reference.

	* Record.pm (show): change the prototype; now the second
	argument is a reference to a list of names, to be used as
	successive keys in the JPEG_RECORD_NAME hash to find the
	description of a numeric key. No argument is needed if the
	key is non-numeric. This allows for more flexibility and
	deeper structures. Other small cosmetic changes.

	* Segment.pm (show): change the test from (defined $this->{parsed})
	into ($this->{parsed} eq "ok") [this was a bug]
	(show_directory): this new method prints all records in a given
	record directory. It is called initially by show(), and can call
	itself when it finds a record containing a reference to another
	record list (this supersedes the old sub-directory mechanism).

	* Segment.pm (search_value_by_key): changed order of arguments.
	Now $dir is the second argument; if it is defined it looks in
	$this->{dirs}{$dir}, otherwise it looks in $this->{records}

	* Record.pm (new): added a "reference" type for records. This
	type will be used only internally to link to subdirectories.
	The show() method and the Tables..pm file needed to be updated.
	
2004-03-12  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

        * Save current state as version 0.0.1
	
	* Segment.pm (parse_app1_exif): sometimes, we have broken pictures
	with a thumbnail in APP1 with an actual size which is shorter than
	the predicted size; nonetheless, the thumbnail is often valid, so
	this case deserves only a warning if the difference is not too
	large (currently, 1 byte).

2004-03-06  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment.pm (create_record, read_record, store_record):
	The data reading routines have been revolutionised in order to
	be simpler, less, and more uniform. Their prototypes:
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	create_record(tag, type, dataref/offset, count)
	             [returns a record reference]
	read_record  (     type, dataref/offset, count)
	             [returns reference->get_value()]
	store_record (tag, type, dataref/offset, count)
	             [inserts + returns record reference]
	-----------------------------------------------------------
	(get_last_record_value), as a consequence could be dropped and
	many other methods needed to be updated to reflect the new 
	prototypes. In particular, all direct calls to the JPEG::Record
	constructor have been replaced by create_record.
	
	* Record.pm (new): The arguments of a record constructor 
	are now: (key, type, dataref, count, endiannes). Other internal
	methods have been updated accordingly (extract).

	* Segment.pm (data): access to a substring of $this->{data}
	is now mediated by this method.

2004-03-05  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>
	
	* Deleted all "Aborting ...\n" in 'die' statements, because
	it is obvious and because showing the index of the error
	causing line is better (and code is shorter ...)
	
	* Segment.pm (new): added a private transient member which
	stores the "current" endianness value; this is only meaningful
	during the parsing routines, and it is reset to undef at the
	end of the constructor. This change gets rid of a very tedious
	parameter to be passed all around.

	* Record.pm (get_size): the logic for calculating the memory
	footprint of a record is now in this class static method.
	Moreover, some details have been abstracted in local variables
	and @JPEG_RECORD_TYPE_LENGTH is now private in the record class.
	Some copies dropped in favour of using references.
	
2004-03-01  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Segment.pm (search_value_by_key): return as soon as a matching
	key is found (identical keys are an error anyway!)
	
	* Segment.pm (get_last_record_value,add_record,search_value_by_key)
	use references instead of copying arrays (at least, I hope this
	is the effect of using @$refname instead of @{$refname}.

2004-02-27  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* replaced computed gotos in Record.pm with ifs for portability.
	More robust parsing of IPTC/NAA data. Added parsing of APP3 and
	APP14. Preliminary work on APP12 and XML meta-data in APP1.

2004-02-04  Stefano Bettelli  <bettelli@localhost>

	* Initial code, with splitting of JPEG sections and parsing of
	COM, APP0, APP1, APP13 (just a try), DQT, DHT, SOF_n and SOS. Only
	showing the parsed tags is supported. Files: Record.pm, Section.pm,
	Structure.pm, Tables.pm
